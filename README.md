# Getting Started 

## How to install

Install all the dependencies:

### `npm test`

Now you have all the node packages and the server, just run: 

### `npm start`

Now you can browse to the project:

### localhost:3000

Recommanded things to check:

1) Filters
2) The modal
3) Performance in term of cache
4) Responsive mode
